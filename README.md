# You Can Pay Any Bill With a Credit Card Via Plastiq
> *Author's Note* - In December 2019, I was given the opportunity to invest in a venture capital fund through Alumni Ventures Group. One of the first companies the fund invested in was Plastiq, which I did not explore until now. -- _Ankur Goel_

## What is Plastiq<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>

Plastiq is a service that lets individuals and businesses use debit or credit cards to pay vendors that don't otherwise accept those payment methods.<sup id="a4">[4](#f4)</sup> For example, most mortgage lenders do not accept credit cards, so payments are made with check, ACH payments, or wire transfer. But Plastiq will act as a middle-man, taking a payment via credit card, and then paying a bill via check (which read as coming from the user, not Plastiq)

In exchange for this convenience, Plastiq charges a processing fee, which can be expensive — as of March 2021, it was 2.85% for credit cards and 1% for debit cards. Further, if the card-payer cannot pay off credit card bills each month, they will incur interest at whatever ongoing rate the card charges.

There are several reasons to use this service:

* It is cheaper than a high-interest option like a cash advance or a pay-day loan.
* It could allow breathing room for a paycheck to arrive
* If the card-user has a rewards credit card, it can help defray the processing fee. Common cards offer between 1.5% and 2% cash-back, or other rewards perks.
* Many rewards card offer large bonuses for signing up if you spend a large amount during an intial period. Using Plastiq for that initial monthly spend can pay back several times over.
* Many card-users prefer the convenience of paying a single credit card bill, instead of having to pay several different bills. Bill-pay services from banks offer similar conveniences.

Common consumer uses for Plastiq include paying:

* rent
* mortgage
* utilties
* day care
* tuition 
* insurance
* taxes and government fees
* homeowners association fees

> *Note* - Different credit cards have different exclusions for what they will allow their cards to be charged. For example, Visa and American Express will not allow their cards to be used on mortgage payments.<sup id="a5">[5](#f5)</sup> 

### Focus on SMBs
As Plastiq has evolved over the last 9 years, Small and Medium Business's (SMBs) have become the larger user of the Plastiq services.<sup id="a6">[6](#f6)</sup>  Plastiq provides them with cash flow, especially for seasonal businesses such a restaurants and tourist companies. Although many companies are in the business of providing cash-flow for small businesses by offering loans, Plastiq simply unlocks a payment opportunity using already existing credit facilities of credit cards. Plastiq is enable $2 billion in transactions, allowing a nearly $100 million revenue run rate.

During the beginning stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, Plastiq was able to help SMBs obtain financing when traditional loan facilities were drying up and not as easy to access.

## Business Activities

## Landscape

With the focus on SMBs, there is no shortage of competition from other companies also trying to solve pain points in small-business cash flow. According to CEO Eliot Buchanan, Plastiq’s biggest competitors are traditional lenders, as well as companies like Kabbage and Fundbox. Similar claims could be made about Brex, which offers a credit card for startups to access capital faster. 

Kabbage provides funding to SMBs through automated business loans. The SoftBank-backed company landed $200 million in a revolving credit line back in July, fresh off of landing strong partnerships with banks and giants like Alibaba to access more customers. Kabbage loans out roughly $2-3 billion to SMBs every year. 

Other Fintech companies that compete in the SMB lending space include:<sup id="a7">[7](#f7)</sup>

 * Lendio - The company connects SMBs with over 300 SBA-approved financial institutions get loan approval instantly, becoming a large facilitator of PPP loans
 * BlueVine - The company offers a full suite of banking services to SMBs including business checking, lines of credit, and invoice factoring
 * Fundbox - a platform to get securely analyze businesses for credit approval
 * CircleUp - provides an investment platform for innovate, early-stage consumer brands.

## Recommendations
### Focus on the ESG
In August 2010, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston issued a report on the consumer ramification of the entire credit card payment system.<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> The report highlights the regressive nature of credit card payments as follows:

1. Consumers look at credit card as a system with perks - points, cash back, delayed payments, etc.
2. But merchants are acutely aware of fees that are proportional to sale, who want to pass on those costs to the consumer. However, credit card companies discourage charging surcharges based on credit card use.
3. Therefore, the merchant increases the costs of goods for all credit **and** cash users.
4. This blanket price increase results in cash-paying households paying $149 to card-using households, and each card-using household receiving $1,133 from cash users every year.
5. Because credit card spending and rewards are positively correlated with high-income households, the entire credit card payment system becomes a regressive transfer of wealth.
6. The paper recommends reducing merchange fees and card rewards to reverse this regressive transfer.

Plastiq represents an alternate method, because they specifically charge a credit card surcharge for using their service. Therefore, cash-using households do not incur a blanket price increase due to card-users, and the card-users pay specfically for the perks they like.
